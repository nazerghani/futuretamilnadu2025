                <h3>Ancient Art and Architecture of Tamilnadu</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px;"></p>
                <!-- <h3 align="center">This Month's Promotions</h3> -->
                <p>Tamil Nadu is the land of temples and a living museum of styles that originated in the 7th century. The temples in Tamil Nadu (some dating to more than 1,700 years old) display intricate carving and sculptures, which bear testimony to the craftsmanship and creativity of the sculptors and artists of ancient India. In Tamil Nadu, one can see huge temple complexes with towering 'Gopurams' (gateways), which are a major part of the Dravidian architectural Temple Architecture, Tamil Nadustyle. Hindu architecture is vigorous while Muslim architecture is virtually non-existent. </p>

                <h3>Temple Architecture</h3>
                <p> Tamil Nadu, the holy land, is the land of temple architecture. The Pallavas, Cholas, Pandyas, Vijayanagar rulers and the Nayakas have made immense contributions to temple art in Tamil Nadu.

                Thousands of temples with lofty towers dot the skyline of the entire state of Tamil Nadu. The Tamils have been the greatest of temple builders. Temples from the pre Christian era as well as those from the 20th century exist in this state, where the ancient rulers have made outstanding contributions to the growth of these monuments of great artistic value. </p>

                <h3>Contributions by various Rulers</h3>
                <p>The cave temples of Pallavas and Pandyas were the beginning in temple architecture. This gave place to structural temples built with cut stones. These types of sculptural decoration are found at Mamandur, Tiruchirappalli and Pallavaram, which are attributed to Mahendravarman. The examples seen at Mamallapuram exhibit a striking variation from the cave temples with bas-reliefs, monoliths and cutout rocks, which were introduced by Mamalla Narasimhavarman I, son of Mahendravarman.The Kailasanathar temple at Kanchipuram, the 'City Of Thousand Temples' and the shore temple at Mamallapuram are the best examples of structural temples, which replaced the rock medium. They are attributed to the eternal noble men Rajasimha and Narasimha Varman II during the same period.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>Followed by Pallavas, the Cholas continued their reign from the middle of the 9th century for over 500 years and established themselves as the superiors among all the dynasties in building mammoth places of worship. They brought significant changes in the structural style with multiple layers, towering 'Gopurams', 'Parivaras' and separate shrine for the goddess. During their period, the land was studded with temples. Their architectural achievement is the Brihadeeswarar temple at Thanjavur. The temples at Parasuram, Thiruverkadu, Kumbakonam, etc. are the best examples of the Cholas final phase, which was a fine degree of perfection in temple architecture.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Vijayanagar rulers made valuable additions to existing temples. They built many structures in a new style. The Gopurams became taller containing richness in sculptural details and the spacious 'Mandapams' became even larger. Their finest specimens are seen at Srirangam, Kanchipuram, Chidambaram and Tiruvannamalai. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                The tallest temple towers at Srivilliputhur, Madurai, Rameswaram and Tirunelveli are the best in the tradition of the Nayak rulers of Madurai who continued the Vijayanagar example and improved the elegance.

                <h3>Current destruction of our Ancient treasures</h3>
                <p style="padding:10px;"></p>
                <p> Temples in Tamil Nadu are repositories of history, with inscriptions, sculptures, murals, bronzes, carvings, architecture and so on. The inscriptions provide valuable insights into the history of the period during which the temples were built, the village administration that prevailed, elections conducted for its assemblies, taxes collected, boards set up for the maintenance of lakes, ponds and canals, donation of land, gifting gold for temple maintenance, etc.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately in Tamil Nadu, the murals, the inscriptions, the sculptures and carvings have become targets of destruction and vandalism. The officials of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) Department, who administers the temples, are to be blamed for this state. Most often, these officials fail to appreciate and preserve these splendid works due to lack of knowledge of history.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                In the famous Meenakshi temple, Madurai, several historic mandapams have become shopping complexes. The Pudhu mandapam, the Ashta Sakti mandapam, Veera Vasantharayar mandapam and Meenakshi Nayakar mandapam teem with hundreds of shops, obstructing from view pillars with incredibly beautiful sculptures. A scholar on the history of the Meenakshi temple was displeased that its 1,000-pillared mandapam, with superb sculptures, has become ‘a studio' now, with an incongruously gleaming granite floor, skewed focus lights and a big sculpture of Nataraja painted in black!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Extremely rare murals painted on wood in the Tirukkutraleeswarar temple at Tirukkutrala Chitra Sabha in Tirunelveli district have been vandalised. At the Siva temple at Patteeswaram, paintings were sandblasted in 1998 in the name of cleaning the surfaces on which they were painted. The paintings portrayed Lord Siva presenting a palanquin studded with pearls to the Saivite saint Tirugnana Sambandar because he could not bear to see his devotee walking in the sun. Temple officials sandblasted another row of paintings narrating the life of a mythical king who had no child but was blessed with a child after praying to Siva at Patteeswaram. Officials of the Lakshminarasimhar temple at Sevilimedu, near Kanchipuram, whitewashed them. They do not exist today.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tales of destruction and desecration of these invaluable murals in temples in Tamil Nadu do not end with this list. What happened to the paintings at the Meenakshi temple at Madurai, the Trilokyanatha Jaina temple at Tiruparuttikunram near Kanchipuram, another Jaina temple at Karanthai near Kanchipuram and the Ramalinga Vilasam Palace in Ramanathapuram town take the cake.</p>

                    <p>If this continues then our invaluable treasure will be destroyed completely, we will be left without identity. Our Governtment is taking many reforms to protect these treasures, on the other hand we have to realize the virtue of our ancient treasures and by joining hand with Government we have to protect them from destruction. We should feel proud to belong to this ancient community.</p>
